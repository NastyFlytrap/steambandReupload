I have no idea how coding or github works, and i cant find the licence of the original steamband, so if you know, tell me.

This is merely a reupload of the latest version to my knowledge, 0.4.1f. I found it on the wayback machine, and i just dont want the game not be accessible to people, especially considering its open source and it was most likely on an open licence too.
Pls dont sue me into oblivion.
